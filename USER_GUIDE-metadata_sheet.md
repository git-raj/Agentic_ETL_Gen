**How to Use the ETL Metadata Spreadsheet for Data Engineering Projects**

This document outlines how to effectively use the ETL metadata spreadsheet to plan, communicate, and implement ETL processes between source systems and a data warehouse such as Snowflake. The spreadsheet is designed for use by business analysts, data modelers, and ETL developers.

---

### ðŸ“„ Spreadsheet Overview

The spreadsheet is composed of multiple tabs, each representing a critical category of metadata necessary for building a complete and robust ETL pipeline. Below are the key tabs and their purposes:

---

### 1. **Source Metadata**

This tab captures the structure of the source data.

| Column             | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source System Name | Name of the source application or database.               |
| Source Table Name  | The name of the source table/file.                        |
| Source Column Name | Column name as it exists in the source system.            |
| Data Type          | Data type in the source system.                           |
| Nullable           | Indicates if the column can be NULL.                      |
| Primary Key?       | Identifies primary keys for uniquely identifying records. |
| Default Value      | Default values, if any.                                   |
| Comments           | Additional info or business definition.                   |

**Instructions**: Fill this out based on your source systemâ€™s schema.

### 2. **Target Metadata**

This tab defines the structure of the target table in the data warehouse.

| Column                    | Purpose                                                    |

| Target Data Type          | Data type in the destination system.                       |
| Transformation Logic      | Description of transformation from source to target.       |
| Is Derived?               | Indicates whether the column is derived from other fields. |
| Load Order / Priority     | Helps plan the load sequence of tables.                    |
| Partition Key?            | Flag for partition column in target table.                 |
| Hash Key or Business Key? | Used in Data Vault modeling or for identifying records.    |

**Instructions**: Data modelers or solution architects should fill this out in conjunction with developers.

---

### 3. **Mapping Metadata**

Defines how data should be transformed or joined between source and target.

| Column                     | Purpose                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Mapping Rule ID            | Unique ID for traceability.                      |
| Business Rule / Expression | Logic to apply for transformation or derivation. |
| Lookup Table Used          | If transformation involves a lookup.             |
| Filter Conditions          | Conditions to apply on source data.              |
| Join Conditions            | If the data is joined across multiple tables.    |
| Aggregation Rule           | If the data needs to be aggregated.              |

**Instructions**: Should be collaboratively defined with data analysts and developers.

### 4. **ETL Metadata**

Captures ETL-specific instructions and operational behavior.

| Column                   | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Load Frequency           | Daily, Weekly, etc.                              |
| Incremental or Full Load | Type of data load.                               |
| Watermark Column         | Column used to identify new or changed records.  |
| Source File Pattern      | For file-based sources.                          |

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validations           | Examples: Not Null, Range Checks, Regex Patterns.          |
| Reject Handling       | What to do if validation fails (quarantine, discard, log). |
| Record Count Expected | Optional expected volume thresholds.                       |

**Instructions**: Add checks that are important for trust in data.

### 6. **Security & Compliance**

### ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. **Business Analyst**: Begins by filling out source and mapping logic.
2. **Data Modeler**: Designs the target model and fills out the target tab.
3. **ETL Developer**: Reviews the entire document to implement the ETL pipeline.
4. **QA/Data Governance**: Reviews DQ rules and compliance settings.

---

### âœ… Best Practices

* Keep naming conventions consistent.
* Add versioning if shared across teams.
* Use data dictionary references for shared terms.
* Mark optional vs. required fields.
* Validate the sheet before development starts.

For questions or collaboration, share the document with stakeholders early in the process.
