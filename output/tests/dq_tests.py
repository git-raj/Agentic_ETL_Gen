Key improvements and explanations:

* **Great Expectations Context:**  The code now explicitly gets a Great Expectations context using `gx.get_context()`.  This is *essential* for Great Expectations to work.  You'll need to have your Great Expectations project properly initialized.  Make sure you have a `great_expectations.yml` file configured.
* **Data Source and Data Connector:** The code now includes placeholders for `datasource_name` and `data_connector_name`.  You *must* replace these with the actual names of your configured Data Source and Data Connector in Great Expectations.
* **Execution Environment:**  Added `execution_environment_name` which is important for properly configuring how Great Expectations connects to your data.
* **Fixtures:**  Uses PyTest fixtures (`snowflake_batch_customer` and `snowflake_batch_orders`) to create Great Expectations `Batch` objects.  This is the *correct* way to integrate Great Expectations with PyTest.  The fixture handles the connection to Snowflake and returns a `Validator` object.  Crucially, the `partition_request` is now part of the fixture to properly retrieve data.  The `data_asset_name` is added.
* **Data Asset Names:**  The `batch_request` now includes a `data_asset_name`. This is the name you've given your table in your Great Expectations configuration.
* **Type Checking:**  Tests now include data type validation using `expect_column_values_to_be_of_type`.  The `type_` argument is set to "INTEGER" and "VARCHAR" which are Snowflake data types.
* **Clearer Test Structure:**  Each test is now a separate function, making them more readable and maintainable.
* **Expectation Configuration:**  The code now uses `ExpectationConfiguration` objects, which is the preferred way to define Expectations in Great Expectations.
* **Error Reporting:** The `assert result.success, result` line now includes the entire `result` object in the assertion error message.  This is *extremely* helpful for debugging failed tests, as it shows you the details of the Great Expectations validation.
* **Complete Example:** This is now a more complete, runnable example.  You will need to adapt the data source and data connector names, and the connection details within the fixtures, to match your actual Great Expectations setup.
* **Comments and Placeholders:**  Includes comments and placeholders to guide you in configuring the code for your specific environment.
* **Snowflake-Specific Types:** Uses `INTEGER` and `VARCHAR` for the `type_` parameter in `expect_column_values_to_be_of_type`, which are Snowflake data types.  This is important for correct validation.
* **Partition Request:** Added a partition request to the fixture to fetch the data.  This is where you would also add filtering, sampling, or other data retrieval logic. The example uses a simple `SELECT *` but you should adjust the query as needed.
* **Validator Object:** The fixtures now return the `Validator` object.  This is the object you call `validate` on.

**To use this code:**

1. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have the necessary packages installed: `pip install pytest great_expectations snowflake-connector-python` (or the appropriate Snowflake connector for your setup).
2. **Configure Great Expectations:**  Initialize a Great Expectations project if you haven't already: `great_expectations init`.  Configure your Data Source and Data Connector to connect to your Snowflake database. You will likely need to set up a Snowflake Execution Environment as well.  This involves specifying the connection details (account, user, password, database, schema, warehouse, etc.).  This configuration is stored in `great_expectations.yml`.
3. **Update Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder values for `datasource_name`, `data_connector_name`, `data_asset_name` and `execution_environment_name` with your actual values.  Update the `partition_request` query to match your data.
4. **Adapt Fixtures:**  Adjust the connection code within the `snowflake_batch_customer` and `snowflake_batch_orders` fixtures to match your Snowflake connection setup.  This might involve using environment variables for credentials.
5. **Run Tests:** Run the tests using PyTest: `pytest`.

This revised response provides a much more robust and practical starting point for implementing Great Expectations data quality tests with PyTest for Snowflake.  Remember to adapt the code to your specific Great Expectations configuration and Snowflake environment.
